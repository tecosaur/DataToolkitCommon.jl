#+title: CSV

* Description

The =csv= driver enables the *parsing* and *serialisation* of CSV data and various
tabular data formats.

* Input/output

The =csv= driver expects data to be provided via ~IO~.

By default this driver announces support for parsing to three data types:
+ ~DataFrame~
+ ~Matrix~
+ ~CSV.File~

Other =Tables= compatible types are of course supported, and can be used directly
(i.e. without having to use the ~CSV.File~ result) by specifying the type with the
=support= transformer keyword.

When writing, any type compatible with ~CSV.write~ can be used directly, to any
storage backend supporting ~IO~.

* Required packages

+ =CSV=

* Parameters

+ args :: keyword arguments to be provided to ~CSV.File~

* Usage examples

#+begin_src toml
[[iris.loader]]
driver = "csv"
#+end_src
