#+title: Introduction

DataToolkitCommon takes the skeleton provided by DataToolkitBase and builds the
basic functionality needed to make DataToolkit actually useful.

To gain an understanding of how these two components fit together, it is
recommended the DataToolkitBase docs be looked at first to understand the
system, and then these docs for useful transformers and plugins to actually work
with your data.
