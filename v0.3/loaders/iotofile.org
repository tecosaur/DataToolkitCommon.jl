#+title: IO to File

* Description

The =io->file= loader serves as a bridge between and backends that produce IO but
not a file path, and any subsequent transformers that require a file.

* Input/output

The =io->file= driver accepts ~IO~ and produces a ~FilePath~.

* Parameters

+ path :: A path to save the file to. If not set, a tempfile will be used.
